""" Hamming Distance - https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance
    
    The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

    Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

    Note:
    0 â‰¤ x, y < 231.

    Example:

    Input: x = 1, y = 4

    Output: 2

    Explanation:
    1   (0 0 0 1)
    4   (0 1 0 0)
           ?   ?

    The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
